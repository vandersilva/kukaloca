# kukaloca
Test bed app for Vanderlei, called kukaloca, to be deployed on Amazon's EC2, using the MEAN stack as a start. 
Eventually, kukaloca will be a playground for learning and having fun with new tech (and at times, be reminded that I am getting older and a bit slower...), like NodeJS, Angular, MongoDB, Express, Machine Learning, Python, Docker, etc.
